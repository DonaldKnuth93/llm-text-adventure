# Headline: Flexible and Easy Conversational AI with Streamlit powered by Clarifai
## By just changing the plain English prompt, quickly experiment with different LLMs and applications

ðŸ‘‰ **TLDR:** This blog post showcases how to build an engaging and versatile chatbot using the Clarifai API and Streamlit. **Links:** Here's the [app](https://llm-text-adventure.streamlit.app/) and the [code](https://github.com/iankelk/llm-text-adventure).

This Streamlit app lets you chat with several Large Language Models. It has two main capabilities:
- It proves how powerful and easy it is to integrate models provided by Clarifai using Streamlit & Langchain
- You can evaluate the responses from multiple LLMs and choose the one which best suits your purpose.
- You can see how just by changing the initial prompt to the LLM, you can completely change the entire nature of the app.

## Introduction
Hello, Streamlit Community! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ian Kelk, a machine learning enthusiast and Developer Relations Manager at Clarifai. My journey into data science began with a strong fascination for AI and its applications, particularly within the lens of natural language processing.

## Problem statement
It can seem intimidating to have to create an entirely new Streamlit app every time you find a new use case for an LLM. It also requires knowing a decent amount of Python and the Streamlit API. What if, instead, we can create completely different apps *just* by changing the prompt? This requires nearly zero programming or expertise, and the results can be surprisingly good. In response to this, I've created a Streamlit chatbot application of sorts, that works with a hidden starting prompt that can radically change its behavour. It combines the interactivity of Streamlit's features with the intelligence of Clarifai's models.

In this post, youâ€™ll learn how to build an AI-powered Chatbot:

Step 1: Create the environment to work with Streamlit locally

Step 2: Create the Secrets File and define the Prompt

Step 3: Set Up the Streamlit App

Step 4: Deploy the app on Streamlit's cloud.


## App overview / Technical details
The application integrates the Clarifai API with a Streamlit interface. Clarifai is known for its superb artificial intelligence models, while Streamlit provides an elegant framework for user interaction. Using a secrets.toml file for secure handling of the Clarifai Personal Authentication Token (PAT) and additional settings, the application allows users to interact with different Language Learning Models (LLMs) using a chat interface. The secret sauce however, is the inclusion of a separate `prompts.py` file which allows for different behaviour of the application purely based on the prompt.

Let's take a look at the app in action:
